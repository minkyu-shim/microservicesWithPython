# Interface layer — HTTP endpoints.
#
# This file defines the FastAPI router and maps HTTP verbs + paths to
# service function calls. It is the only layer that knows about HTTP.
#
# Rules:
# - Never call repository functions directly — always go through service
# - Catch ValueError from the service layer and raise HTTPException instead
# - Use Depends(get_db) to inject the database session
#
# This file should expose:
# - POST   /v1/users/          -> create a user
# - GET    /v1/users/          -> list users (with limit/offset pagination)
# - GET    /v1/users/{user_id} -> get one user by ID (404 if not found)
#
# See the README for the full implementation.
